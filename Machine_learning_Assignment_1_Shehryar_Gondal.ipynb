    "\n",
    "1. __Artificial Intelligence:__ Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as perception, reasoning, learning, decision-making, and natural language processing. An example of AI would be an AI-powered virtual assistant like Siri or Alexa that can understand and respond to voice commands, make appointments, and answer questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Machine Learning:__ Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI that involves training a computer system to learn patterns and relationships in data without being explicitly programmed. An example of machine learning would be a machine learning algorithm that can predict whether a customer will buy a product based on their past purchasing behavior and demographic information.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Deep Learning:__ Deep learning (DL) is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to learn and represent complex patterns in data. An example of deep learning would be a deep learning algorithm that can recognize faces in images with high accuracy, even when the faces are partially obscured or at different angles."

    "__Ans)__ Supervised learning is a type of machine learning in which a computer algorithm is trained on labeled data, meaning the data has input features and corresponding output labels. The goal is to train the algorithm to learn a mapping between the input features and the output labels, so that it can accurately predict the output labels for new, unseen input data.\n",

    "__Ans)__ Supervised learning uses labeled data to train a machine learning algorithm to predict output labels for new input data. Unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data to discover patterns and relationships in the data. Semi-supervised learning is a combination of both labeled and unlabeled data, where the labeled data is used to improve the accuracy of the model and the unlabeled data is used to find additional patterns in the data."

    "\n",
    "__Ans)__ In machine learning, the dataset is commonly split into three parts: the training set, the validation set, and the test set. The training set is used to train the machine learning algorithm to make accurate predictions on new data. The validation set is used to select the best performing model and tune its hyperparameters, while the test set is used to evaluate the final performance of the model on new, unseen data. Each split is important for improving and evaluating the performance of machine learning models."

    "__Q7: How can unsupervised learning be used in anomaly detection?__\n",
    "\n",
    "__Ans)__ Unsupervised learning can be used in anomaly detection by learning the patterns and structures in a dataset without any prior knowledge of what constitutes normal or abnormal behavior. The algorithm can then identify data points or observations that deviate significantly from these learned patterns as anomalies or outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "__For example, one common unsupervised learning algorithm used for anomaly detection is clustering. In this approach, the algorithm groups similar data points into clusters based on their distance from each other. Data points that do not belong to any cluster or are far away from the clusters can be considered as anomalies.__\n",
    "\n",
    "__Another approach is to use dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA (Principal Component Analysis) or autoencoders to reduce the high-dimensional data to a lower-dimensional representation that captures the most important features or patterns in the data. Anomalies can then be identified as data points that do not fit well with the low-dimensional representation of the majority of the data.__\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, unsupervised learning can be a useful approach for anomaly detection in cases where labeled data is scarce or the anomalies are difficult to define in advance."
